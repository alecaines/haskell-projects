# haskell-projects
A sample of some projects written in Haskell for CSCI-215, Programming Language Development. To initialize the haskell shell, navigate to the directory containing the target files and run "ghci" in the cmd. To load a file, run ":load filename.hs" in the cmd. In order to run any of the functions in the file, type the function name and the required inputs as "functionname input_1 input_2 ... input_n"

# project1
project1 explores different mathematical functions in haskell, namely exponentiation.

## power
The power function returns the exponentiation of a given base and exponent. To test, load project1 and run "power base exponent" and observe output.

## bouncy
This is a tial recursive function that returns the distance traveled by a bouncing ball. To test, load project1 and run "bouncy initial_height bounciness_index multiplicity number_of_bounces" and observe output.

## newton
This functino returns an approximatino to the square root of a given number. To test, load project1 and run "newton number iteratation tolerance"

# project 2
project2 provides a set of functions entailing the structure of an association list with mutation and iteration.

## get
To test the get function, run "get key value list_of_tuples_ordered_by_key_and_value" and observe the output.

## pop
To test the pop function, run "pop key list_of_tuples_ordered_by_key_and_value" and observe output.

## put
To test the put function, run "put key value list_of_tuples_ordered_by_key_and_value" and observe output.
